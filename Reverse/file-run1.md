# file-run1
## Description
A program has been provided to you, what happens if you try to run it on the command line?

Attached file: run
## Solution
As the hints suggest, we have to make the file runnable using chmod +x command on linux. To do this, open WSL and navigate to the "mnt" folder from where you can access local files on your PC.

On finding the folder, we can run the commands
```
chmod +x run
./run
```
which will print out the flag.
## Answer
```
The flag is: picoCTF{U51N6_Y0Ur_F1r57_F113_9bc52b6b}
